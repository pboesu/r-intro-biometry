Plotting our data is one of the best ways to
quickly explore it and the various relationships
between variables.

There are three main plotting systems in R,
the [base plotting system][base], the [lattice][lattice]
package, and the [ggplot2][ggplot2] package.

[base]: http://www.statmethods.net/graphs/
[lattice]: http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/trellis.html
[ggplot2]: http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/ggplot2.html

Today we'll be learning about the base package, which implements commonly used plotting tasks without the need for additional packages. Base plotting is very stable, and allows highly customized plotting, but elaborate figures often require elaborate code.
